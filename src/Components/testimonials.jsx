      "It was built to provide a platform that could more directly connect local farmers to afforadable storage warehouses with available space. It also provides farmers with transparent, direct-sale options rather than having to go through third parties. With better storage options, farmers are not forced to sell off their crops early and potentially lose profits. Less food is lost to spoilage, so more people can eat.",
